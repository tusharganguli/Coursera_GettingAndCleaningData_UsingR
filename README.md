==================================================================
Author: Tushar Ganguli.
==================================================================

The intent of this project was to follow the guidelines and end up with a set of tidy data.
Following were the instruction to comply with:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
 
1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
    of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'CodeBook.md' : Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed on the data.

- 'averageData.txt': Final output after following step 5 as mentioned above.

- 'run_analysis.R': Main script file for running the analysis.
